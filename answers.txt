Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is useful to track large sets of changes to code. For example, if a bug is discovered in one version of code, it is possible to revert to an older version, and if multiple people are working on different parts of the code, they can work on different branches that are merged at a later point.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science is highly applicable to the political sciences, where people's behavior can be used to predict whether they will favor a given policy. Given Nate Silver's success in predicting previous election results, this is a promising application.
